# editing of WNV sequences for test 
4 sequences removed due to the incomplete sequences -> these 4 are noted in metadata.csv 
All sampling dates are available for the remaining sequences so use these in the tree
When I originally ran the analysis through iqtree the dates were lost in the names of the sequences due to spaces.
I have fixed these in the 01 script which generated france_wnf_aligned_renamed.fasta which 
I then used to run the analysis through iqtree and look at in TempEst.
